# CS-499-Capstone-Project
## Overview
Hello welcome to my CS 499 Capstone Project. I will be talking about my three enhancements for the projects that I have worked on at SNHU. My first two enhancements will be from my CS 250 Software Development Lifecycle class and the last one will be from my DAD 220 Introduction to SQL class. I will break it down each section, as follows:
 - [Enhancement One](#enhancement-one)
 - [Enhancement Two](#enhancement-two)
 - [Enhancement Three](#enhancement-three)
 - [Code Review](#code-review)
 - [Professional Self Assessment](#professional-self-assessment)

## Enhancement One
My CS 250 - Software Development Lifecycle course project was a slide show that included 5 top destinations that I did for my SNHU travel project. Within each slide show, it stated the location and small description. Also, on each slide you could click on the image and it would redirect you to the website of the destination. It was made on a Java file that had the data hardcoded onto the code and generates a JAR file with all the slides with a previous and next button. Here is the example of it and a link with the files [cs_250](https://github.com/carlos-rodriguez17/CS-499-Capstone-Project/tree/main/slide_show/cs_250):

For the improvement, I linked a SQLite database to hold the information of the destinations and free up space on the coded file. I used Visual Studio Code to make the modifications for the slideshow and I connected that to the database. Once I connected the database, I made the modification of adding CRUD functions to the slideshow to help the admin easily alter the data without having to go onto VS code and it would update automatically onto the database. The design was slightly modified but I left it open and not overly complicated to make the software scalable and manageable. Here is an example of the new updated slideshow and the codes [enhancement_one](https://github.com/carlos-rodriguez17/CS-499-Capstone-Project/tree/main/slide_show/enhancement_one):

## Enhancement Two
My second enhancement will continue to be working through the CS 250 slide show project. This enhancement will focus on the algorithm and data structures of the system. I made the adjustments on this Java file through my Visual Studio Code system. The modifications I made for it was I added filters to help sort the slideshow and make it easier to find, like alphabetical order, cost (low to high or high to low), rating (low to high or high to low). I gave it a more modern look to it and here is the example of it and the link with the files

## Code Review
Below is a link to the code review that I prepared for my enhancements. It highlights the code and what I plan to do to improve the systems:
