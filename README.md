# CS-499-Capstone-Project
## Overview
Hello welcome to my CS 499 Capstone Project. I will be talking about my three enhancements for the projects that I have worked on at SNHU. My first two enhancements will be from my CS 250 Software Development Lifecycle class and the last one will be from my DAD 220 Introduction to SQL class. I will break it down each section, as follows:
 - [Enhancement One](#enhancement-one)
 - [Enhancement Two](#enhancement-two)
 - [Enhancement Three](#enhancement-three)
 - [Code Review](#code-review)
 - [Professional Self Assessment](#professional-self-assessment)

## Enhancement One
My course project was a slide show that included 5 top destinations that I did for my SNHU travel project. Within each slide show, it stated the location and small description. Also, on each slide you could click on the image and it would redirect you to the website of the destination.
