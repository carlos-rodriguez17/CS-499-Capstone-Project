# CS-499-Capstone-Project
## Overview
Hello welcome to my CS 499 Capstone Project. I will be talking about my three enhancements for the projects that I have worked on at SNHU. My first two enhancements will be from my CS 250 Software Development Lifecycle class and the last one will be from my DAD 220 Introduction to SQL class. I will break it down each section, as follows:
 - [Professional Self Assessment](#professional-self-assessment)
 - [Enhancement One](#enhancement-one)
 - [Enhancement Two](#enhancement-two)
 - [Enhancement Three](#enhancement-three)
 - [Code Review](#code-review)

## Professional Self Assessment

My time at Southern New Hampshire University was very rewarding and challenging from day one. I was able to constantly learn new programs and softwares through my core classes and electives. I got the opportunity to use OpenGL to render a 3D model of my vinyl record player setup. It was very fun to do but also very challenging because of the constant errors and testing that I had to encounter. Another fun project was learning how AI algorithms work and how we would be able to develop quicker and more efficient algorithms in the form of a Treasure Maze. The way I did this was by running the codes on a Jupyter Notebook and seeing the algorithms finish faster and faster when it would be running through a Deep Q-Learning. I learned different softwares like Codio, R studio, Android Studio, MongoDB, Jupyter Notebook and various other programs. I believe my foundation knowledge of Python helped me to understand the different languages because they each had their differences but had very similar structures and rules. Given these new languages that I had to learn, I quickly had to adapt and was eager to learn new skills. These constant new lessons and programs showcase the willingness and strive to learn to become a more competitive candidate and someone who wants to make an impact with the future team that I join. I want to show how I can quickly learn and be resourceful for the company and strive to be better with my skills. Collaborating in a team environment is something that I can strongly accomodate for and take into consideration throughout the process. The emphasis and need of having a well-documented/ established in-text comments is important for the code so that others understand what you are doing and help improve the scalability for further improvement. When documenting this and properly organizing it, it will make it easier to present to the stakeholders and make them understand the thoughout process. It is important to understand the audience and make sure that the stakeholders understand the non-technical terms and believe in what you have created. My understanding of algorithms were developed through reinforcement learning assignments like the Deep Q-Learning Treasure Maze project. I applied algorithmic reasoning in a more advanced context, combining neural networks with experience replay. Working with databases were very easy to maneuver with the help of SQL but could be tedious. The implementation of CRUD functions helped to make the changes a lot faster and not having to rewrite the entire codes each time. Security is one of the most integral parts of all software and programs. Having a strong emphasis on it will not only help protect the company but protect the data of all the users who have used it. Making sure that you follow the best security guidelines will help to build trust with the community and every business partner involved. Setting up secure endpoints and constantly testing for any issues within the system is important to consider throughout the entire process. It will feel like second nature but will never feel neglected when considering this integral to the system.  

Each enhancement is integral to showcase all my skills that I learned throughout the program and hopes to showcase some of my creativity to make the system feel unique. Each enhancement will hopefully showcase how I can provide value and relevant input into the system. The artifacts will cover the areas of data structures and algorithms, software engineering and database.

## Enhancement One
My CS 250 - Software Development Lifecycle course project was a slide show that included 5 top destinations that I did for my SNHU travel project. Within each slide show, it stated the location and small description. Also, on each slide you could click on the image and it would redirect you to the website of the destination. It was made on a Java file that had the data hardcoded onto the code and generates a JAR file with all the slides with a previous and next button. Here is the example of it and a link with the files [cs_250](https://github.com/carlos-rodriguez17/CS-499-Capstone-Project/tree/main/slide_show/cs_250):

For the improvement, I linked a SQLite database to hold the information of the destinations and free up space on the coded file. I used Visual Studio Code to make the modifications for the slideshow and I connected that to the database. Once I connected the database, I made the modification of adding CRUD functions to the slideshow to help the admin easily alter the data without having to go onto VS code and it would update automatically onto the database. The design was slightly modified but I left it open and not overly complicated to make the software scalable and manageable. Here is an example of the new updated slideshow and the codes [enhancement_one](https://github.com/carlos-rodriguez17/CS-499-Capstone-Project/tree/main/slide_show/enhancement_one):

## Enhancement Two
My second enhancement will continue to be working through the CS 250 slide show project. This enhancement will focus on the algorithm and data structures of the system. I made the adjustments on this Java file through my Visual Studio Code system. The modifications I made for it was I added filters to help sort the slideshow and make it easier to find, like alphabetical order, cost (low to high or high to low), rating (low to high or high to low). I gave it a more modern look to it and here is the example of it and the link with the files 
[enhancement_two](https://github.com/carlos-rodriguez17/CS-499-Capstone-Project/tree/main/slide_show/enhancement_two):

## Enhancement Three
My third enhancement is from my DAD 220 - Intro to SQL class and it is a project about customers data and car sales/ parts throughout the US. The database was developed using SQL and through Codio. Here is an example of it and the files
[enhancement_three](https://github.com/carlos-rodriguez17/CS-499-Capstone-Project/tree/main/_database/enhancement_three):

To make it easier, I connected the database to MongoDB and created a HTML 4000 file to be able to update the data much easier. When creating the codes through Visual Studio Code, I was able to develop the database management below:

## Code Review
Below is a link to the code review that I prepared for my enhancements. It highlights the code and what I plan to do to improve the systems:
